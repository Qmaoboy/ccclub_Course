As King waved goodbye to the audience, George Raveling, volunteering as a security guard at the event, asked King if he could have the original typewritten manuscript of the speech.[74] Raveling, a star Villanova Wildcats college basketball player, was on the podium with King at that moment.[75] King gave it to him.
